⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: MOCK IMPLEMENTATION ⚠️

This file contains MOCK responses and violates the project's NO MOCKS principle.
DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

This implementation was created incorrectly and needs to be replaced with real MCP communication.
See BUG-002-mcp-mock-implementation.md for details on how to fix this.

The correct implementation should:
1. Use subprocess to communicate with MCP Server via stdio protocol
2. Send proper JSON-RPC messages
3. Return real analysis results from the 117+ MCP tools

This file should be:
- Deleted and replaced with real implementation
- OR renamed to client_mock.py and kept only as reference
- Never used in production code
