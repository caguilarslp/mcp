# WADM Development Log

## 2024-12-27

### Initial Setup - v0.1.0
- Created project structure (src/, collectors/, indicators/, models/, storage/)
- Implemented base WebSocket collector with reconnection logic
- Created Bybit and Binance collectors for trade data
- Implemented Volume Profile calculator (POC, VAH, VAL)
- Implemented Order Flow calculator (delta, cumulative delta, absorption detection)
- Created MongoDB storage manager with TTL indexes
- Set up simple logging system
- Created main manager to coordinate everything

### Architecture Decisions
- KISS principle - simple and functional first
- No mocks or complex tests initially
- Direct file writes, no artifacts
- Async by default for all I/O operations
- MongoDB for storage with automatic data cleanup
- Trade buffers to batch processing

### Current Features
- Real-time trade collection from Bybit and Binance
- Volume Profile calculation every 50+ trades
- Order Flow metrics with cumulative delta tracking
- Automatic data retention (1h trades, 24h indicators)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Basic error recovery and reconnection

### Next Steps
1. Test the basic system
2. Add more indicators (VWAP, Footprint charts)
3. Create simple API for data access
4. Add Docker support once stable
5. Implement MCP server for integration

### Fixes Applied
- Fixed Binance WebSocket URL and subscription format
- Fixed graceful shutdown handling with proper async event
- Changed from trade to aggTrade stream for Binance
- Fixed Binance trade ID field (uses 'a' not 't')
- Added more logging and reduced batch size for faster processing

### Current Status
- ✅ System connects to both exchanges
- ✅ Trades are being collected (1454 trades in test)
- ⚠️ Indicators not calculating yet - needs investigation
- ✅ MongoDB storage working
- ✅ Graceful shutdown working

### Known Issues
- Indicators not being calculated despite having enough trades
- Need to investigate the trade retrieval query from MongoDB
- May need to adjust the time window or calculation logic
