# MCP Integration Fix Status

## ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **Import Error**: `get_api_key` dependency was missing - FIXED
2. **Session Type**: Changed from `SessionUsage` to `SessionResponse` - FIXED  
3. **Missing Method**: Added `track_endpoint_usage` to SessionService - FIXED
4. **MongoDB Manager**: Added local instance to avoid circular imports - FIXED

## ⚠️ Still Needs Fixing (BUG-002)
The MCP integration is currently using MOCK responses instead of real MCP communication.

### Current State
- All endpoints return hardcoded/simulated data
- No actual communication with MCP Server
- Violates NO MOCKS principle

### Required Actions
1. Replace `client_http.py` mock implementation with real MCP communication
2. Use subprocess to communicate with MCP Server via stdio protocol
3. Implement proper JSON-RPC message format
4. Test with real MCP tools

### Time Estimate
- 4 hours to implement proper MCP communication
- See `claude/bugs/BUG-002-mcp-mock-implementation.md` for details

## Testing
Once the API is running again, you can test with:
```bash
python test_mcp_integration.py
```

Note: Results will be mock data until BUG-002 is fixed.
